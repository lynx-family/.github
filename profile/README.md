# Lynx

Lynx is a family of cross-platform technologies that help you build truly native user experiences with a Web-friendly development experience.


## About Lynx

#### üöÄ High Performance at Scale
Lynx is designed for speed, offering an instant loading experience and native UI responsiveness through a custom layout engine and a browser-inspired multithreading architecture, whether used standalone or embedded within native views.

#### ‚öîÔ∏è Versatility across Platforms
"Write once, run anywhere." Lynx approaches this with versatile rendering strategies: mature native rendering for Android and iOS, evolving support for the Web, and consistent rendering across mobile and desktop (e.g. Windows and macOS) through a custom renderer.

#### üåê Web-Inspired Development
Lynx features a rich set of CSS with optimization-focused extensions as its styling language, along with optimized JavaScript runtimes and a variety of web-inspired APIs, making it easier to leverage your existing knowledge on Web, React, and to port more Web libraries.
